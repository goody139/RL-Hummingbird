# RL-Hummingbird
This repository is still in progress and not finished yet. The idea is to have a Unity environment and to make a bird collect nectar of flowers by reinforcement learning. The bird should learn how to fly and to decide for the best paths. The idea and the assets are based on a unity learn tutorial https://learn.unity.com/course/ml-agents-hummingbirds.
